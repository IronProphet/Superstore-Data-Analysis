Retail Profitability & Discount Policy Review
Executive Brief

A retail dataset of ~10,000 U.S. transactions (2011–2014) was analyzed to assess the financial impact of discount strategies across product categories.

The analysis reveals a structural profitability issue driven primarily by aggressive discounting.


Core Problem

Despite $2.3M in total sales, profitability is unstable and highly sensitive to discount levels.

Beyond a 30% discount threshold, average profit turns negative, with deep losses occurring in high-discount segments (40%–80%).


Key Findings

• Profit collapses beyond ~30% discount
• 301 SKUs consistently generate negative profit
• Furniture (Tables, Chairs, Bookcases) is most discount-sensitive
• Average discount on profitable orders: 8%
• Average discount on loss-making orders: 48%

High-ticket items remain profitable only when discounting is tightly controlled.

Financial Risk Drivers

Uniform discount policies applied across categories

Clearance-level discounts (60–80%) destroying margins

Structural pricing issues in specific SKUs

Strategic Recommendations

Enforce a 30% discount cap across vulnerable categories

Reprice or remove structurally loss-making SKUs (301 identified)

Shift promotional focus toward consistently profitable segments (Paper, Labels, Accessories)

Bundle high-margin products to offset lower-margin categories


Analytical Approach

• Data validation & cleaning
• Discount bin segmentation
• Pivot-based margin sensitivity analysis
• SKU-level profitability breakdown
• Executive visualization & reporting
